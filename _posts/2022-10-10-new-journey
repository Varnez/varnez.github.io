 With this post, I begin a new journey.
 
 General Artificial Intelligence is something that has always been able to spark a flame of the best kind of curiosity there is within me, but, in a sense, 
 even though it would be obvious to do so, it is a curiosity I've never actually persued to develop into actuall founded knowdledge.
 
 With the start of my master's degree and the open question of a thesis project, I think the time is nigh to get my hands on this matter once and for all.
 
 This is my first post of what will be a recopilation of material, publications and personal notes on the current state of the art in the ambit of General 
 Artificial Intelligence.
 
 Also, in this header notes I might ramble a little. Sorry for that. 
 
 I think it is within the blood: as much as I wanted this to be as straight to the point as I could make it, one cannot avoid giving their ego a voice. 
 At least when it comes to that one being me.
 
 Let us begin.

With this very first post(s?) I aim to get a general view of the current state of General Artificial Intelligence, as well as the current open approach paths.

After visiting a couple of post with very straightforward searches, it is easy to realice that, nowadays, the conversation is very shifted towards separating 
the necessity of shaping AGI entirely after the human mind. It seems obvious to base our idea of General Intelligence in the most, let's say, advance case of 
it that we can find (given that other animals can still be considered to posses a mean of General Intelligence), but as it is wonderfully exposed in the following 
article, [(The flawed quest for Artificial General Intelligence - do you need to know how the mind works for AGI?)](https://diginomica.com/flawed-quest-artificial-general-intelligence-do-you-need-know-how-mind-works-agi): 

> The problem is that developing a human-level AI without understanding how the mind works will be an entity that does not possess the same reality as humans.

As it develops, this consideration seem rooted in that the current environment of AGI is focused on reproducing said General Intelligence only from the perspective of 
the mind as a fenomena that takes place uniquely on the brain, while [current cognitive theories (Embodied Cognition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) find our cognitive system deeply rooted within the complete extent of 
our nervous system.

Nevertheless, in that same previously mentioned article, there is a very interesting quote from Ray Kurzweil, Google’s Director of Engineering:

> We have to use different techniques — different **self-organizing methods** — that are biologically inspired.

I wanted to make a heavy emphasis to those **self-organizing methods**, because as far as I currently know, that is the base the current main paths being nowadays 
taken in AGI: a self-organizig hierarchical system of multiple levels of intelligence, being the current narrow approaches the smallest 'lego brick' within this 
structure.

In those lines, I would right no think there is no better authory to get on board in such a complex topic than the own François Chollet, already mentioned in the 
previous article, as well in probably most any other article on the topic out there. In 2019, he published his work [On Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547).

In this white paper, François Chollet points out the current differences in scope when we speak on Intelligence, depending on it being Biological or Artificial. This
was a few years ago - AGI hadn't earned yet a place in the mediatic spotlight, and the expentancies on narrow AI were as prevalent as they might ever be, thus such a
take on Artificial Intelligence take.

The problem has in roots in conceiving Intelligence itself: it will only grow as much as we are able to concieve it might grow, and thus if we want it to break a 
certain given limit, it is imperative for us to be able instruct the machine a set of objetives that translate into the breakthrough of said task.

Thus, one of the main point in Chollet's paper is a measurement of this ambit of Generallity for an Intelligent system. At least, this is as much as I know, since I 
have to admit, not without shame, that I still haven't properly read his paper in its full extent. That is my next main objective, since I want all the insight it 
contains to be a part of my mental landscape on the topic before I consider next steps.

In the meant time, very unlike me in any other ambit of getting to know a thing, I've made me a few spoilers by reading a couple of brief articles summarizing its 
contents, just to have a lead on what to expect within the paper's pages.

- https://pgpbpadilla.github.io/chollet-general-intelligence-test
- https://roberttlange.github.io/posts/2020/02/on-the-measure-of-intelligence/

In them it is highlighted its inspiration on [Psychometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics). As Robert Tjarko Lange writes in the second article:

> Chollet proposes to develop human-centered tests of intelligence which incorporate human cognitive priors & the developmental psychology notion of core knowledge.<br/> (...) <br/>Additionally, Chollet provides a formal algorithmic information theory-based measure of the intelligence of an artificial system.

Thus, it seems to tackle those two previous points: the proper contextualization of Intelligence given an artificial system in contrast to a biological, holistic
system and trying to adapt the teaching from the field of Psychometrics into a mean to evaluate the generalization (addressed straightforward as Intelligence itself)
capabilities of an artificial system.

My next article(s ?) will revolve around my own notes as I traverse and gain ingisht on the inner bellies of this insighful work.
